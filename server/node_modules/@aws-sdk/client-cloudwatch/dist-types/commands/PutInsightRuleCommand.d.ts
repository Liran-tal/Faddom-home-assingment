/**
 * <p>Creates a Contributor Insights rule. Rules evaluate log events in a
 * 		CloudWatch Logs log group, enabling you to find contributor data for the log events in that log group. For more information,
 * 		see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ContributorInsights.html">Using Contributor Insights to Analyze High-Cardinality Data</a>.</p>
 * 		       <p>If you create a rule, delete it, and then re-create it with the same name, historical data from the first time
 * 			the rule was created might not be available.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { CloudWatchClient, PutInsightRuleCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-cloudwatch"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { CloudWatchClient, PutInsightRuleCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-cloudwatch"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new CloudWatchClient(config);
 * const command = new PutInsightRuleCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link PutInsightRuleCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link PutInsightRuleCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link CloudWatchClientResolvedConfig | config} for CloudWatchClient's `config` shape.
